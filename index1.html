      <strong id="Salaar-title" class="title"> Salaar: Part 1</strong> –
      Ceasefire &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is a 2023 Indian Telugu-language
      epic neo-noir action thriller film directed by Prashanth Neel and produced
      by Vijay Kiragandur under Hombale Films. The film stars Prabhas in the

      Haasan, Jagapathi Babu, Bobby Simha, Sriya Reddy, Ramachandra Raju, John
      Vijay, Easwari Rao, Tinnu Anand, Devaraj, Brahmaji and Mime Gopi. In the
      fictional dystopian city-state of Khansaar, where monarchy still exists,
      the film follows the friendship between Deva (Prabhas), the exiled prince
      of Khansaar, and Varadha (Prithviraj Sukumaran), the current prince of
      Khansaar. When a coup d'état is planned by his father's ministers and his
      relatives, Varadha enlists Deva's help to become Khansaar's undisputed
      ruler. The film's initial storyline was pitched from Neel's debut film
      Ugramm (2014) and is the maiden part of a two-part film.[4] It was
      officially announced in December 2020 under the title Salaar, however, in
      July 2023, its first instalment was titled as Salaar: Part 1 – Ceasefire.
      Principal photography commenced in January 2021, and occurred sporadically
      in several legs over nearly three years, before wrapping in late 2023.
      Filming locations included Telangana, Italy and Budapest. Production
      difficulties, ranging from the pandemic, reshoots and VFX delays,
      postponed Salaar's release date several times. The music is composed by
      Ravi Basrur, cinematography handled by Bhuvan Gowda and editing by Ujwal
      Kulkarni.

      <strong>Varanasi[b]</strong> is an upcoming Indian Telugu-language epic
      action-adventure film[7] directed by S. S. Rajamouli, who co-wrote the
      screenplay with V. Vijayendra Prasad. Produced by Sri Durga Arts and
      Showing Business, the film stars Mahesh Babu, Priyanka Chopra, and
      Prithviraj Sukumaran. This is Chopra's first Indian film in eight years.
      Rajamouli conceived the film as a globetrotting adventure rooted in Indian
      cultural themes, drawing inspiration from the structure and emotional tone
      of classic adventure cinema.[c] Initial discussions for a collaboration
      with Mahesh Babu began in 2010, but the project materialised only after
      the completion of RRR (2022). The film was formally launched with a puja
      in January 2025, and principal photography commenced the following month
      in Hyderabad. Filming and production later moved to Tanzania, Kenya and
      Odisha. With a budget of over ₹1,300 crore ($150 million), Varanasi is set
      to become one of the most expensive Indian films ever made. The film has
      music composed by M. M. Keeravani, with production design by Mohan Bingi,
      cinematography by P. S. Vinod, editing by Bikkina Thammiraju and visual
      effects by V. Srinivas Mohan. Varanasi is the first Indian film to be shot
      in 1.43:1 IMAX format. The film is scheduled to be theatrically released
      in 2027.
